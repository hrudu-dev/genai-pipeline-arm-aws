# GenAI Pipeline Project Summary

## Project Overview

The GenAI Pipeline is a production-ready, cost-optimized AI inference pipeline built on AWS. It leverages AWS Bedrock for AI model access and AWS Lambda with ARM64/Graviton architecture for optimal cost and performance.

## Key Components

1. **Lambda Function**: Serverless compute for AI inference
2. **Bedrock Integration**: Access to Claude AI models
3. **ARM64/Graviton**: Cost-optimized compute architecture
4. **Function URL**: Direct HTTPS access to the API
5. **Web UI**: Simple interface for interacting with the API
6. **Interactive CLI**: Command-line interface for testing

## Current Deployment

The project is currently deployed with the following resources:

- **Lambda Function**: GenAIPipelineTest2
- **Function URL**: https://btjml6cwvtetuz4mraonqwyqbq0aeotc.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/
- **IAM Role**: lambda-bedrock-role
- **Region**: us-east-1

## CI/CD and Maintenance

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD and maintenance:

1. **CI Workflow**: Runs tests on every push and pull request
2. **Deploy Workflow**: Deploys the Lambda function to AWS
3. **Maintenance Workflow**: Updates dependencies and cleans up old resources
4. **Documentation Workflow**: Builds and deploys documentation

For more details, see [GitHub Actions Documentation](docs/github-actions.md).

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. Review the [README.md](README.md) for an overview
2. Follow the [GETTING-STARTED.md](GETTING-STARTED.md) for setup instructions
3. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for deployment options
4. Use [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for testing instructions

## Available Tools

The project includes several tools for interacting with the API:

1. **test_local.py**: Test Bedrock integration locally
2. **test_api.py**: Test the deployed API
3. **run_interactive.py**: Interactive CLI for testing
4. **serve_ui.py**: Web UI for testing
5. **batch_processing.py**: Process multiple prompts in parallel
6. **cleanup_aws_resources.py**: Clean up old AWS resources

## Next Steps

Consider the following next steps for the project:

1. **API Gateway Integration**: Add authentication, rate limiting, and custom domains
2. **CloudWatch Monitoring**: Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting
3. **Multi-Region Deployment**: Deploy to multiple regions for redundancy and lower latency
4. **Request Caching**: Implement caching for improved performance and reduced costs
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up automated testing and deployment
